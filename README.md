# Learning Project - Task Management System

This is a learning project that implements a task management system. It has a backend developed in **Node.js** with **Express** and a **frontend** created with **React** and **ViteJS**. The project uses JWT authentication, integrates a MongoDB database, and includes an interface for managing users and tasks. It also implements automated tests on both the backend and frontend to ensure code quality.

## Funcionalidades Principais

### Backend

- JWT authentication.
- User management (creation, update, deletion and authentication).
- Task management (creation, editing, deletion and search).
- Protection against brute force attacks with rate-limiting.
- Access and error logs using Winston.
- Modularized structure for routes, middlewares and controllers.
- Automated testing with Jest and Supertest.

### Frontend

- Interface to manage users and tasks.
- Modals for editing usernames and passwords.
- Task search system with real-time suggestions.
- State management with React contexts (`AuthContext`, `UserContext` and `TaskContext`).
- Component and E2E testing with Cypress.

## Available Scripts

### Backend

- `npm run dev`: Starts the server in development mode.
- `npm start`: Starts the server in production mode.
- `npm test`: Runs automated tests with Jest and Supertest.

### Frontend

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Generates the production-optimized files.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production application locally.
- `npm run cy:open`: Opens Cypress for E2E and component testing.

## Tests

### Backend

- Tests are located in the `backend/tests` folder.
- Technologies: **Jest** and **Supertest**.
- Tests cover:
  - Authentication (login, logout).
  - CRUD operations of users and tasks.
  - Error validation (e.g. invalid authentication, missing data).

### Frontend

- E2E and component testing with **Cypress**.
- Test files located in the `frontend/cypress` folder.
- Tests include:
  - Login and authentication flow.
  - User management (update, delete).
  - Task search and management.
  - Component and modal validation.
